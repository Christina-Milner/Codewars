/* Given a 10 x 10 2D array  (this does not need to be validated), return whether or not it is a valid Battleship setup.
This means:
    - 1 boat of 4, 2 boats of 3, 3 boats of 2, and 4 boats of 1 - no more, no less
    - Boats can't touch or be adjacent to each other, even diagonally
    - Boats are straight lines
*/

//P: An array of arrays of numbers
//R: A boolean

/*
- So, a cell with a 1 in it can be:
    - A submarine (surrounded on all sides by 0s/undefined)
    - The end piece of a ship (all 0s except one direction)
    - The middle piece of a ship (all 0s except two sides that must either be left and right or top and bottom)
- So as a starting point, iterate over the array and check those 3 conditions - any "1" that isn't one of those 3 can return an instant false
- Or alternatively, start by looking for all 1s that are surrounded by nothing on all sides
    - Check if their number is exactly 4
    - Then change them to 0s
- Then repeat this process with the longer boats? I gotta try it out.

/* Voil√†! Rewrote it a little bit even after it passed the tests and I submitted it to CW, because I noticed I'd put "x" instead of "y" in the verticalNeighbors section of the big for loop, but when I fixed that,
it stopped passing. So there was clearly something else wrong with it that the tests didn't catch, but should be all good now. */
